Here is the next task. Let's set up the tgm_ionic repo on your machine, and make some changes to it. The setup is relatively difficult, and I'll help you out with it.

Here is the repo, and the current branch is the alphabetically-latest (currently 0.1.2): https://github.com/piousbox/tgm_ionic/tree/0.1.2

To login, you need (1) https and (2) tgm.mac domain. So you need something like an apache proxy https://tgm.mac -> http://localhost:8100 . I have an entry in /etc/hosts pointing tgm.mac to 127.0.0.1 and I use this virtual site: https://github.com/piousbox/tgm_ionic/blob/0.1.2/etc/httpd/sites-enabled/ssl-tgm-ionic.conf and you have to generate your own self-signed certificate. Having a warning is okay. You should commit your virtual site definition in this folder: https://github.com/piousbox/tgm_ionic/blob/0.1.2/etc/httpd/sites-enabled/ssl-tgm-ionic.conf

The application is up and running here: https://tgm.piousbox.com specifically the /homefeed page. The tasks are:

* fix scrollbars. There should be only the reasonable scrollbars up-down, and each newsitem's scrollbar left-right should look good
* each element (photo) in the newsitem should be fit-height or fit-width (whichever is larger), so that they can be viewed nicer
* Optional: Each photo should be clickable to take the full screen. Have a button [x] to close.
* optional: when I'm looking at each photo, swiping left/right should bring previous/next photo of the newsitem. And for desktop, having icons [<-] and [->] to go to previous & next photo, when in this "full-screen" mode.

If you need assistance, don't hesitate to ask!
