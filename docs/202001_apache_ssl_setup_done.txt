= Setup =

Here are setup instructions:
* download apache from https://www.apachelounge.com/download/ and install it
* Add tgm.mac as a domain in your hosts file, on Windows XP it is this file: c:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
 127.0.0.1 tgm.mac
* The ssl certificate and key are generated and available at etc/tgm.mac.crt, etc/tgm.mac.key .
* use this as an example virtual site definition, proxying to port 8100. You can change the location of the certificate/key, and save your own virtual site definition in this repo so you don't lose it.
 https://github.com/piousbox/tgm_ionic/blob/0.1.1/etc/httpd/sites-enabled/ssl-tgm-ionic-2.conf 
* run the application on port 8100.
